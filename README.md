# SpotifyUI Recreation using SwiftUI
In this project, I recreated Spotify UI's using SwiftUI. Throughout this project, I gained profiency in using skills such as VStack, HStack, and ZStack while prioritizing UI and accessibility within the design. Furthermore, the play/pause, shuffle, and slider allow the user to interact with the UI of the app.
